## TODOs

* unify all table sizes, paddings etc.
* especially reduce size of noscript table
* refine wording
* combing "Calculation" and "Imaging format sizes"
* refine typohraphy
* explicit background color for body and or html elements (dark mode in MacOS might otherwise fuck things up)

## IDEAs

* Mark common focal length for each format
* gradient from wide to long?
* only show one column somehow???
* opacity gradient?
* Mark column, rather than rows.
* mark the normal length (even maybe only as ghost focal length, because in 35mm for example, 43mm is not a very common focal length)
* try CSS vars
* Fuji Medium Format
